# V1, V2, V3 Components - Quick Reference Guide

## 🚀 Quick Overview

Your Titanic ML project implements three core components that work together:

### **V2** → **V1** → **V3**
Feature Selection → Model Training → Performance Validation

## 📋 Component Summary

| Component | Purpose | Key Output | Performance |
|-----------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **V2: Chi-Square Feature Selection** | Statistical feature selection | 5 significant features | Removed 2 irrelevant features |
| **V1: Train-Test Split** | Quick model evaluation | 74.16% accuracy | Conservative estimate |
| **V3: Cross-Validation** | Robust model validation | 78.52% ± 3.22% | Reliable estimate |

## 🎯 Key Results from Your Run

### V2 - Selected Features:
✅ **Pclass** (Chi2: 102.889, p < 0.001) - Passenger class matters most
✅ **Sex** (Chi2: 260.717, p < 0.001) - Gender is strongest predictor  
✅ **SibSp** (Chi2: 37.272, p < 0.001) - Siblings/spouses count
✅ **Parch** (Chi2: 27.926, p < 0.001) - Parents/children count
✅ **Embarked** (Chi2: 26.489, p < 0.001) - Port of embarkation

❌ **PassengerId** (p = 0.484) - Just an ID number
❌ **Age** (p = 0.101) - Not statistically significant

### V1 - Train-Test Performance:
- **Accuracy**: 74.16%
- **Precision**: 65.75% 
- **Recall**: 69.57%

### V3 - Cross-Validation Performance:
- **Mean Accuracy**: 78.52% (±3.22%)
- **Fold Range**: 74.16% to 82.49%
- **Precision**: 73.65%
- **Recall**: 68.24%

## 🔍 What Each Component Does

### V2: Chi-Square Feature Selection
```python
# Tests each feature's relationship with survival
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(data[feature], data["Survived"])
chi2, p_value, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

if p_value < 0.05:
    # Feature is statistically significant
    significant_features.append(feature)
```

**Result**: Keeps only features that have a statistically significant relationship with survival.

### V1: Train-Test Split Evaluation
```python
# Split data 80/20 for training/testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model and evaluate
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

**Result**: Quick performance estimate using one random split.

### V3: Cross-Validation Comparison
```python
# 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X_scaled, y, cv=5, scoring="accuracy")
y_cv_pred = cross_val_predict(model, X_scaled, y, cv=5)
```

**Result**: More reliable performance estimate using multiple data splits.
